Translating Original C# App to Java


Also keep track of and report how long it took you to accomplish each step of the of the process: 
1. Design Solution:
* This part took me the longest. I think I must have re-read the prompt at least twenty times. Maybe I would say a weekend day while also taking plenty of breaks to do other life tasks (cleaning, working out, grocery shopping etc).
* I also made a point to define some of the regions by hand using Excel. This took me about two hours? 
2. Code solution and debug:
* I made a point to copy/ paste the wording of the prompt into the source code so I could hint how I understood each sentence. 
* Ultimately, since I have not written any Java in 4+ years, I chose to first write the solution in C# to wrap my mind around the problem and then to translate it. I think the C# sample is a better representation of my skills and thought process, and I am sure with more practice, I would do similarly in Java. In C# I think I spent about 6 hours. And then just under an hour translating into Java 
3. Polish the source code:
* I added a test solution in the C# proj, asserting my work with one of the chromosome sets. Then also splitting out the methods. I try to continually refactor my code in general while I work instead of writing one giant solution and going back and remembering everything. Maybe an hour? 
4. What I would do with more time:
* I would go through and try to count out my project in Big-O Notation. This is just something I have personally started working on in the last few weeks, and I find it helps me to think and refactor. However, I'm still getting in the swing of it, so it takes me a long time. 
* I would have added a hard coded test for a more complex chromosome. 
* I would have made my Marker and Region classes richer. Something I like about Java more than C# is how it sort of drives you to give your objects richer behavior and it pulls you away from procedural code.
